# saas-subscription-mrr-churn-excel-analysis
Tracking MRR growth, customer churn, and retention using subscription billing data

The data wasn’t pre-aggregated. I had to define churn logic, engineer monthly MRR, and build lifecycle flags before any analysis. 

Also;

-Dates need standardization & month logic
-Plan names need normalization (Basic / Pro / Enterprise)
-Churn logic is not pre-defined
-No monthly table exists
-No MRR table exists
-No lifecycle flags (new / active / churned)
-Business metrics (MRR, churn rate, ARPC) are not given
