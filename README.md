# saas-subscription-mrr-churn-excel-analysis

Data Preparation & Modeling:
Loaded raw SaaS subscription data into Excel and used Power Query to clean, normalize, and restructure it for analysis. Built a month-end calendar and expanded customer records to a customer–month grain, enabling accurate tracking of lifecycle behavior over time. Applied explicit date-based logic to retain only valid subscription periods between signup and churn, creating a reliable foundation for Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), churn, and retention analysis.
